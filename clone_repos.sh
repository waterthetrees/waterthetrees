# This script is meant to be run from the parent directory of all the repos. Once you clone waterthetrees/waterthetrees, you can run this script to clone all the other repos.
# Usage: ./clone_repos.sh from the waterthetrees directory.
# wtt_db is the only repo that uses git-lfs, so it will be cloned using git-lfs. It clones and tracks the treedb.sql postgres database dump file.
